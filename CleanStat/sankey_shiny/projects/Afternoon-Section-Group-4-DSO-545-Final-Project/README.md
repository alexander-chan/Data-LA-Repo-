# DSO545-Group-4

For majority of codes, we used the data exported from https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2016/ndkd-k878, and the csv is too large to be uploaded. Only the codes of regression part were written based on the '311_Data.csv' from https://performance.lacity.org/Government/311-Data/u7vv-5qst.

The whole repository includes Rcode, Report and Presentation Slides.
